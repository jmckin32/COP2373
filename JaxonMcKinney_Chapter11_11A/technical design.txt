A program that deals a five card poker hand and asks the user which cards to replace (essentially 5 card draw)

Variables:
card_list: the cards
cards_in_play_list: the hand
discards_list: the cards discarded
dk: the deck
discard: which cards to discard
inp: input for the loop

Functions:
__init__: creates a deck
deal: deals out a card
ex_deal: gets a card from the deck without appending to the hand
new_hand: clears the hand
discard_replace: replaces a card in the hand with a new card from the deck
main: simulates a five card draw game

(the deck class)
1. sets the cards_list to have every possible card in a stanard playing card deck with both suit and rank
2. also creates lists for the hand and the discard pile, and shuffles the deck
3. the deal function checks if theres any cards left in the deck, if not, then it adds the discard pile to the deck and reshuffles, then creates a new card to append to the hand
4. ex_deal does the same as deal, but without the appending
5. new_hand function discards the hand
6. discard_replace adds the specified card to the discard pile, and replaces it with a new card
(main)
1. creates the deck
2. deals 5 cards and prints the hand
3. asks which cards to discard from the hand
4. discards the specified cards from the hand using the discard_replace function
5. asks if the user wants to play again, if not, breaks the loop
