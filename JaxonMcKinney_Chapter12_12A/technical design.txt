A program that takes the grades.csv file, turns it into a numpy array, and displays it, calculates mean median standard deviation max and min, displays which scores got over a 60 (passing), and the percentage of passing

Variables:
a = saves the array

Functions:
just main()

1. save the csv file as a numpy array, and chop off the first two columns since they just save the names as nans
2. Display the calculations of the scores
 2a. mean
 2b. median
 2c. standard deviation
 2d. maximum
 2e. minimum
3. Display if each score was passing
4. Calculate and display the percentage of scores that pass
