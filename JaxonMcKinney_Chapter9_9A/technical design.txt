Program for a Bank Account class with values for name, acc #, interest rate, balance; and methods for changing interest rate, changing balance, displaying balance, calculating the interest for a certain amount of days, and returning the values in the object as a string

Variables:
  BankAcc:
   name: name
   accNum: account number
   balance: balance
   intRate: interest rate
  main():
   inp: for input stuff
   obj1: creating a test BankAcc object with predetermine values

Functions:
  main():
   Just lets the user test the methods of the BankAcc class

1: Defines the BankAcc class
 1a: inititalizes the values. including name, acc#, balance, and interest rate
 1b: Create the methods
  1b1: add/subIntRate(), withdraw(), deposit() are just simple value changes
  1b2: displayBalance just returns the balance
  1b3: intCalc asks for number of days, and then prints the result of the P*R*T formula, rounded to 2 decimals
  1b4: __str__() returns each value in string format
2: (now inside of main()) Creates a test obj1 object using BankAcc with some predetermined values
3: Creates a loop, listing each method and asking the user which method to perform
4: Determining which method to perform using a switch, and quitting the loop whenever the user says so (the sleep is so the user can have some time to looks at the results of the method before the loop restarts)
