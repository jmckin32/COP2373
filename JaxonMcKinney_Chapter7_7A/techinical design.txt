A program where a user inputs as many sentences as they want and the program displays the sentences individually as well as how many sentences they inputted.

sentences: stores the string input from the user, used as s in the sentence_find() function
pat: the formatting for a "full sentence"
m: stores the individual sentences

main(): mostly just for getting the input from the user, main() was super small in this one (only 2 actual lines)
sentence_find(): finds the individual sentences in the sentences the user inputted earlier and displays the # of sentences as well as the individual sentences

1. Get the input from the user, which is the only thing main() does in this so the rest is gonna be how sentence_find() runs
2. Define the pattern for what counts as a sentence, to break it down:
  2a. "[A-Z0-9]"  Sentence must start with  a capital letter or a number
  2b. ".*?"  Followed by any amount of other characters
  2c. "[.!?]"  Must end in a proper punctuation mark (. or ? or !)
  2d. "(?=...)"  Looking ahead to check if it is followed by:
   2d1. " [A-Z0-9]"  A space followed by another capital letter or number
   2d2. "|$"  Or the end of the string
3. We then find each individual sentence with findall() and store it in m
4. Display how many sentences was found using len()
5. And then for each sentence found, display each individual sentence
