A program that gets the angle and an adjacent side of a triangle and displays the length of the hypotenuse

Variables:
angle: the angle
side: the adjacent side
result: the resulting hypotenuse

Functions:
just the main() one

1. Get the angle
2. Get the adjacent side
3. Start getting the hypotenuse
 3a. divides the adjacent side by the cosine ofthe angle (remember to convert to radians)
 3b. round to two digits
4. Display result
