CreateCSV: Creates a CSV file for any amount of students (first and last name) + their scores for 3 exams
ReadCSV: Reads the CSV file and displays the stats in a table format

numStudents: the number of students
x (in the "for i in range(numStudents):": input for each row

main(): both programs only use main() as since its being split up in two programs each for only one use there wasnt much use in making extra functions i believed. they work and read well enough on their own anyway.
