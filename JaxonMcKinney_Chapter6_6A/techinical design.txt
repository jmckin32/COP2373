User inputs phone number, SSN, zip code, and the program checks for proper formatting of each number

phoneNumberPat: for phone number formatting
ssnPat: ssn format
zipPat: zip code format
phoneNumber: saves phone number
ssn: saves ssn
zip: saves zip code
inp: for user input
flag: for loops

main(): for main program
phone_number_search(): for checking phone number formatting
ssn_search(): for checking ssn formatting
zip_search(): for checking zip code formatting

1. Initialize all my variables, including compiling the format patterns
2. Get 3 seperate loops for each number which:
  2a. Asks user for input
  2b. Puts the input through the respective format check function to see if it fits
  2c. If the formatting fits, break the loop and move on; if not, continue the loop
  2d. After the loop is escaped, flag is reset so the next loop may loop
3. Display the values received at the end as I think it's good for user clarity
