A program that creates a database of 10 Florida cities, and has functions to replicate a growth of .02 every 20 years

Variables:
connection - a connection with the database
cursor - the sql cursor
choich - choosing stuff

Functions:
main() - main
growthCalc() - calculates the growth over 20 years for all cities, then saves back into the database
plotGrowth() - takes one city, and plots the growth over a certain amount of years*20

growthCalc()
1: create the cursor
2: for every row in the population column
 2a: get the population and clean up the extra stuff so its just an int
 2b: calculate the growth formula and save it to itself
3: for every row in the year column
 3a: get year and clean up
 3b: add 20 to the year

plotGrowth()
1: create the cursor
2: display the cities to choose from
3: get inputs for which city to calc, and how many years to calc
4: set the x plot points
5: get the starting y plot point
6: calculate the growth formula and add to the y plot points
7: display the plot

main()
1: create/access the database and the cursor for the database
2: create the table if not already created
3: create the values on the table
4: display initial table values
5: ask user how many times to perform growthCalc, if not 0:
 5a: do the growthCalc that many times
 5b: display the new table
6: do the plotGrowth function
